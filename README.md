# Multiplication Table Generator

## Project Overview

A simple single page application allowing dynamically created multiplication tables through the use of several input fields. This project was created as a personal challenge, enabling me to work with several new techniques and methodologies throughout its development.

### New Techniques and Learning outcomes

- Working with new HTML element types
  - Table creation elements
  - Input fields
  
- Working with regular expressions
  - Creating new expressions
  - Using within string comparisons
  
- Blocking Javascript `eventListener` functionality
  - Using `preventDefault` and `stopImmediatePropagation` functions
  
- Implementing various error checks
  - Checking inputted characters for legality
  - Checking required fields contain a value
  - Applying error styling when errors occur

- Creating map objects
- Fixing git merge conflicts
